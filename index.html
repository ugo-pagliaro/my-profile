		<h2>My Experiences</h2>
		<p>
		In January 2018, my class an I went to Rome, Italy to participate in a Model United Nations where we took part in geopolitical debates in English with other students, acting for the delegation of different countries. In May, my class and I decided to organize our own MUN in our HIgh Scool and it was a success.
		In June 2019, I worked as an intern in an general-acountant's office.

		<h2>
		My Future
		</h2>
		<p>
		I do not know what i want to do after I graduate IESEG but I count on the years to come to help me find a way that will interest me. For the moment I am really intrested in Law, Geopolitics and Mathematics so I hope I will find a job that will combine these 3 subjects.
